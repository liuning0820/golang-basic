# Go Slices

Arrays have their place, but they’re a bit inflexible, so you don’t see them too often in Go code. Slices, though, are everywhere. They build on arrays to provide great power and convenience.

A slice literal is declared just like an array literal, except you leave out the element count:

```go

letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}

```
